# Improve Error Handling and Logging for OTA Updates with RAUC

# This pull request focuses on enhancing the Over The Air (OTA) update process using the RAUC (Robust Auto-Update Controller) system for the Home Assistant Operating System. During OTA updates, there have been cases where failure logs are minimal, making it difficult for users to troubleshoot. This PR introduces:

# Improved Error Logging:

# Added more detailed logging for each step of the OTA process, capturing specific RAUC status codes and detailed error messages.
# Ensured that logs include timestamps and device-specific information for better troubleshooting.
# Enhanced Error Handling:

# Introduced fallback mechanisms to automatically retry failed updates in case of transient issues (e.g., network disconnection during the update process).
# If an update fails, the system now reverts to a safe state while retaining logs for further analysis.
# Added a more user-friendly error message when the update cannot proceed due to insufficient disk space.

# Documentation Updates:
# Updated the documentation to guide users through collecting detailed logs if an OTA update fails.
# Added troubleshooting steps for common RAUC update errors (such as signature verification failure or connectivity issues).

# Testing:
# Tested on: Raspberry Pi 4, ODROID, and x86-64 systems (Intel NUC).
# OTA updates were tested in environments with intermittent network connections and low disk space to validate error handling improvements.
# Logs were reviewed to ensure that all relevant information is captured.

# Related Issue:
# This PR addresses issue , where users reported minimal logging for OTA update failures, making debugging difficult.

# Checklist:
#  Code conforms to the projectâ€™s contribution guidelines.
#  Tested on relevant hardware.
#  Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.

# Additional Comments:
# This improvement aims to reduce user frustration during OTA updates and make the process more robust, especially on lower-end hardware like Raspberry Pi. Future work could include automated disk space checks before updates begin.
